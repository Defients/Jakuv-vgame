Rejected by his peers, Taloff disappeared into the outer layers of the Normie Realm—emerging years later with the first VyCorp implant schematics and a self-modified body. Though not yet fully mechanized, Taloff had begun replacing his organic systems, including the controversial NeuroAuditory Control Ring embedded behind his left eye (covered by an iconic ocular patch in this early phase). At this point in the campaign, Taloff is testing both himself and the viability of compliance-through-upgrade. His duel in Jakuv is not merely about victory—he's measuring your evolutionary potential. If you impress him, you may survive. If not… he’ll recycle your inefficiency.",
